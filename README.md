# 🌌 Parallax Project

This project is my **first exploration into parallax effects** on the web. Parallax is a design technique where background elements move at a different speed than foreground elements, creating a sense of depth and motion. It’s a fun way to bring illustrations and storytelling to life in the browser ✨.

## 🎨 About this project

* All **illustrations** were created by me 🖌️
* The **code** was reused and adapted from a Skillshare class I took on parallax basics
* This was my **first hands-on experience** combining visuals with interactive effects

## 🚀 What’s next

For my **next parallax project** I’ll be:

* Writing the code fully myself
* Creating a fresh set of illustrations
* Experimenting with more playful and interactive effects
